A LEGEND OF GOAT ISLAND




    It is told in Indian story,
    Dim tradition of the race,
    How, to God's eternal glory,
    And through His all-saving grace,
    Many a warrior's heart was stirred
    To belief in His ever-living Word,
    And the Faith that saves us all,
    By a Priest, whose holy mission
    Overcame their superstition
    About the Island, which divides
    Niagara's tumultuous tides,
    At the brink of the mighty Fall.

    Here is the story, as 'tis told
    In one of the chronicles of old.


    'Twas many a year ago, when o'er
    The land on Ni-a-gára's shore
    The Neuter tribe held sway.
    On its western bank, above, but near,
    Where rapids begin, in wild career
    Toward the Fall, and down as low
    As a bark canoe could safely go,
    One of their villages lay.
    In that village by the river,
    Late one eve, when bow and quiver
    Had been laid aside,
    And the warriors were sitting
    In the silence, deemed befitting
    To an Indian's pride,
    A stranger in their midst appeared,
    Whose hoary locks and silvery beard
    Were to their vision strange and weird.
    He was a man of giant size,
    Which found him favor in their eyes,
    As, at his priestly garb amazed,
    In silent wonderment they gazed.

    He wore his Sacred Order's gown,
    A long loose robe of reddish brown,
    Across his shoulders, lightly flung,
    The cape and cowl backward hung,
    Around his waist a rope was twined,
    A girdle and a scourge combined;
    While from it, hanging loose and free,
    Suspended hung the rosary.
    He was the first of stranger race
    They e'er had met with, face to face,
    Though they knew that such-frocked men
    Had visited their brethren.
    When they saw him, brave and squaw
    Viewed him with a reverend awe.

    A wanderer, all alone he came,
    He bore no weapons, gave no name.
    He said his errand was to teach
    The glories of the Life to be,
    When, after death, men's spirits reach
    The confines of Eternity,
    And, as he spake in Indian speech,
    They listened most attentively.
    For he had dwelt for many a day
    Mid Indian tribes, far, far away,
    And thus had learnt the Indian tongue
    From those whom he had dwelt among.
    So, sullenly, they let him share

    Their fire's warmth and frugal fare,
    And then they suffered him to tell
    His mission in the way he chose,
    Though little cared they what befell
    Their souls, so they but feasted well,
    And were victorious o'er their foes.

    Later on, as they were sitting
    In the fire's cheerful light,
    Shadows round them weirdly flitting,
    As the moon rose into sight,
    The stranger asked, in tones of wonder,
    Whence that sound of endless thunder,
    That dull, reverberating sound
    That seemed to shake the very ground?

    For answer, came the Chief's command,
    "Be patient, you shall understand."
    And, knowing Indian nature well,
    He waited till they chose to tell.

    Later yet, when chill and hoary
    Lay the frost upon the ground,
    And the moon in all her glory
    Bathed in light the scene around,
    The Chieftain rose, around him drew

    The bison skin of tawny hue,
    And signed to the priest to follow.
    He led him through a dense dark wood
    Where many a lofty pine tree stood,
    Then through a winding hollow;
    Whence, as they suddenly emerged,
    The rushing rapids 'neath them surged
    O'er many a rocky ledge.
    Taking, down stream, their silent way
    Toward the rising cloud of spray,
    They reached the Cataract's edge;
    And, from a jutting shelf of stone,
    Saw Ni-a-gára, then unknown,
    Save to the red man's Race alone.
    Earth's grandest sight, conceived to be
    The emblem of God's majesty.

    Ne'er has the scene which 'neath them lay
    Been chronicled aright,
    For no one, in a fitting way,
    By pen, nor pencil, _can_ portray
    The grandeur of that sight.

    The Priest, as by the view amazed,
    Long at the Falls and Rapids gazed,
    But not a word he spoke,
    Then crossed himself, as if in awe,
    And 'twas a holy sight he saw.
    At last he turned him to his guide,
    Who stood, like statue, by his side
    And thus the silence broke:

    "For two years past I've often longed
    This wondrous sight to see,
    And memory has oft been thronged
    With stories told to me
    By one, upon whose brow I traced
    God's holy Cross, a chief
    In whose narration I have placed
    An absolute belief.
    The glories, which I now behold,
    In words, somewhat like these, he told:
        'Towards the Sun's ascending beam,
        Whoe'er his journey takes,
        Will reach a broad and rapid stream
        Which joins two mighty lakes.
        Midway in this river's course
        A wondrous fall is found
        Where, with an overwhelming force
        The waters, rushing in their might,
        Plunge downward o'er a fearful height
        With a stupefying sound.
        Right at the precipice so steep,
        Where the river takes this awful leap,
        Is placed an Island, small in size,
        But like an earthly paradise,
        For lovelier spot is nowhere found
        Than this, our Indian burial ground;
        Where none, unless with honor crowned,
        Can ever be interred.
        None but brave men e'er can reach
        It's wooded shore and rocky beach,
        Whereon the sound of human speech
        Is scarcely ever heard.
        For on this Isle deep-buried lie
        The bones of many a Brave,
        And Indian chiefs invariably
        Ask this spot for their grave.
        Thus it has been, in days of yore,
        And it is my earnest prayer,
        That, when this mortal life is o'er,
        And my soul is on the other shore,
        My bones may be buried there.
        That Ni-a-gáh-ra's mighty roar
        So solemn, grand and deep,
        May be my dirge forevermore
        As 'twixt its Falls I sleep.'
    "Since he told me I've often prayed
    That hither I might be led,
    And to my vision be displayed,
    In its scenic majesty arrayed,
    The fairest spot God ever made,
    This Island of the dead."

    The Chief assented, "All you heard
    Was true to the minutest word;
    But one more fact I must unfold
    Ere all the Island's tale is told,
    Note its wondrous situation,
    'Tis our Spirit's dread abode;
    'Tis a spot that, since Creation,
    Coward's foot has never trod.
    None but warriors can reach it,
    Others, should they dare to try,
    So our old traditions teach it,
    As they touch its soil, they die."

    "All that is false," the Priest replied,
    "Whoever taught you that has lied;
    Strong words, I know, but justified,
    For God alone, who gave us breath,
    Has power over life and death."

    The Chief declared, "His faith is best
    Who dares to put it to the test.
    I judge men's faith in but one way,
    'Tis what they do, not what they say.
    If you believe that you'll survive,
    I'll take you there tonight,
    And, if you tread its shore alive,
    Will own that you are right;
    Then, I'll believe in what you preach,
    And worship Him of whom you teach."

    The Priest responded, "Now 'tis clear,
    Why I have been directed here.
    Your sacred Island is to be
    My means of proving conclusively
    To Indian Tribes forevermore
    The power of Him whom I adore.
    An early proof is all I crave,
    For never yet did Indian brave,
    Who'd traveled far to deal the blow
    Of death to his relentless foe
    With greater joy await the hour
    That placed his victim in his power
    Than I impatiently await
    The moment yonder Isle I reach,
    And thereby clearly demonstrate
    The holy precepts that I teach.
    So come, tho' here I fain would stay
    My beads to tell and prayers to say,
    I'll worship God on the Island's shore
    After the test you name is o'er."

    A look of wonder and surprise
    Shone in the Indian Chieftain's eyes,
    His sole reply, "So let it be,
    Your death shall pay the penalty."

    In perfect silence back they went,
    Each on the coming voyage intent.
    When the village they had reached,
    To where his bark canoe lay beached
    The Chieftain turned aside.
    (The bison skin, he flung therein),
    Quickly he launched it, in he leapt,
    And, waiting till the Priest had stept
    Into his place, he bade him kneel,
    So the bark might ride on even keel,
    Then pushed it out on the tide.
    Swiftly it darted from the land,
    Propelled by strong and fearless hand,
    Over the dangerous current flies,
    As the Chief the paddle rapidly plies,
    Until, the wildest portion crossed,
    The frail canoe is no longer tossed
    By curling waves, but floats, awhile,
    On the quiet stream above the Isle,
    Towards whose beach it slowly glides
    For weal or woe, as its voyage betides.

    The Priest stood up, above his head
    The holy Cross he raised,
    And the words of the "Misereri" said
    As heavenwards he gazed.

    The bark meanwhile,
                Has reached the Isle,
    A moment more,
                And the test is o'er.

    The Priest stepped boldly on the sod,
    To prove the power of his God,
    And, kneeling on the shore,
    Poured forth a psalm of praise to Him
    Whom Cherubim and Seraphim
    Continually adore.

    Then, rising, he addressed the Chief
    Who, sitting in the bark canoe,
    Felt more of wonder than of grief
    At seeing that his old belief
    Was wholly false, for now he knew
    That all the Priest had said was true.

    "I tread this Isle alive, and show
    Your Spirit's boasted power
    To be but falsehood; will you now
    Fulfill your solemn Chieftain's vow,
    And own that God, by whom I'm sent
    To teach you, is omnipotent,
    In this auspicious hour?"

    As by the issue stupefied,
    The Chieftain doubtingly replied,
    "I little thought you now would be
    Alive to claim my fealty;
    But further proof you yet must give
    Before I can fully agree,
    Although you tread the Isle, and live,
    You have proved conclusively
    That the Spirit I've adored so long
    Is powerless, and my worship wrong.
    Perhaps that Spirit, seeing you cared
    So little for death, your life has spared
    Thus far, but if you long remain
    On the Isle, you surely shall be slain.
    So, if you heed my advice, return."
    Haughtily spake the Priest, "I spurn
    Your advice, so artfully given.
    Daring your Spirit, I have shown
    The power of death belongs alone
    To Him, who on the great white Throne,
    Dwelleth forever in Heaven.
    Now, ponder well before you speak,
    Then tell what further proof you seek."

    Answered the Chief, "I leave you here,
    With none to aid you, naught to cheer,
    And when tomorrow's sun
    Is high in the heavens, I'll come again.
    If, then, I find you have not been slain
    By my Spirit's might,
    For your act tonight,
    Your victory will be won."

    The Priest replied, "I'll give anew
    This proof, that all my words are true;
    But, do not come till another day
    In its rapid flight has passed away.
    When, next, the rays of the setting sun
    Illumine the Falls, as the day is done,
    Go to the spot where tonight we stood,
    Close to the edge of the headlong flood,
    At that hour, and at this edge
    Of that same Fall, on the rocky ledge
    Of the Island's shore, I'll take my stand
    That you, and all your warrior band,
    May see that I live; and then to show
    That faith in your Spirit you disavow,
    Kneel down, and there, beside the Fall,
    In the name of God, I will bless you all.
    Then, at this hour, tomorrow night,
    In yonder moon's effulgent light,
    Bring your bark to this spot once more,
    And take me back to the other shore.
    Now go, and leave me, despite your fear,
    Alone with my Maker, who led me here."

    The Chief, where the quiet waters lay,
    Up stream, pursued his homeward way,
    To wait the close of another day.
    The Priest, beneath those lofty trees,
    In adoration fell on his knees.

    All night long, on that wonderful sod,
    Where never before had white man trod,
    He wandered, ceaselessly praising God
    For the mercies to him granted.
    Oft, in worship he bowed his head,
    His beads he told, his prayers he said.
    And, 'mid those graves of unknown dead,
    O'er whom no burial rites were read,
    The "Nunc Dimittis" he chanted.
    All next day, in the forest's shade,
    In solitude, he watched and prayed.

    And that evening, at the hour
    When, in lands where Christians dwell,
    From each old cathedral tower
    Rings aloud the Vesper bell,
    The aged Priest his way did wend
    Toward the setting sun,
    To where, at the Island's western end
    The greater waves of rapids descend,
    And the swifter currents run.
    Adown the slope he made his way
    'Mid bushes wet with driven spray,
    Until he reached the rocky ledge,
    Close to the Cataract's eastern edge.
    While he stood there, in the blaze
    Of the setting sun's departing rays,
    The spray-cloud hovered low,
    And, as it settled above his head,
    Across it, in gorgeous colors spread,
    Appeared the sign of the promise made
    By God to man, as the Flood He stayed,
    The evanescent Bow.

    When the sun in splendor sank
    Behind the fir trees tall,
    Gazing toward the farther bank,
    With a joy no pen can e'er describe,
    He saw the Chief and warrior tribe
    At the other end of the Fall.

    The Chief, who saw him as he moved
    From out the forest's shade,
    And realized that again he'd proved
    The truth of all he said,
    Knelt, so the Priest might comprehend
    That faith in his Spirit was at an end.
    The warriors knelt beside their Chief,
    Thus emphasizing their belief.

    The Priest was there by God's own will,
    A holy mission to fulfill.
    His human voice, in that grand roar,
    Could not have reached the other shore,
    No matter how he had striven,
    Yet he spake the Word,
    Though it was not heard,
    And he raised his hands,
    As our God commands,
    And lifted his eyes to Heaven;
    Thus, in the way the Church decrees
    To suppliants, tho' afar, on their knees,
    Was the Benediction given.

    The Priest was with emotion thrilled,
    His mind with sacred thoughts instilled,
    And, in imaginative mood,
    Again in a holy Church he stood,
    (It was three long years since he
    Had stept within a Sacristy).

    A wondrous Church it was, indeed,
    By Nature's changeless laws decreed,
    Tho' man reared not the structure fair,
    All churchly attributes were there.

    The gorge was the glorified Nave,
    Whose floor was the emerald wave.
    The mighty Fall
    Was the Reredos tall,
    The Altar, the pure white foam,
    The azure sky,
    So clear and high,
    Was simply the vaulted Dome.
    The column of spray,
    On its upward way,
    Was the smoke of Incense burned;
    The Cataract's roar,
    Now less, now more,
    As it rose and fell,
    Like an organ's swell
    Into sacred music turned.
    While, like a Baldachin, o'erhead
    The spray-cloud, in its glory, spread
    Its crest, by the setting sun illumed,
    The form of a holy Cross assumed.

    The vision gone, the Priest once more
    Stood, simply on the Island's shore.
    Slowly he climbed the bank again,
    And into the forest passed,
    His body weak with cold and pain
    From his long and sleepless fast.
    Little he cared for the food and rest
    His mortal being craved,
    He only thought, how, at his behest,
    The Chief and warriors had confessed
    Belief in God, and had been blest,
    And their souls might thus be saved.

    Again, amongst the trees he knelt,
    Expressive of the joy he felt.
    In worship, loud, his voice he raised,
    His tones through the forest rang,
    As the ever-living God he praised,
    And the "Jubilate" sang.

    The twilight passed, but the aged Priest
    From his adorations had not ceased;
    The darkness came, but his only thought
    Was praise of Him whose word he taught;
    The moon arose, and found him there,
    Still in the attitude of prayer.
    But when in the Heavens, high and clear
    She stood, and midnight's hour was near,
    He rose and went to the rocky beach,
    Where alone the Island one may reach.

    Soon the Chief, in his birchen bark,
    Came swiftly over the waters dark,
    And reaching the Island's shore
    Cried, "As God's follower, receive
    An erring man. I now believe
    In Him, forevermore."

    As the Priest to meet him came
    He said, "Baptize me, in His name."
    The Priest bent down to the river's bed
    And dipped his hand in the wave,
    Then bade him kneel, and on his head
    Poured the water, and joyously said,
    "Your soul I hereby save.
    First convert of the Neuter race,
    Upon your forehead, thus, I trace
    The Cross's holy sign;
    And thereby, as you now believe
    In God's omnipotence, receive
    You into His Church divine.
    And, in the Faith you have confessed,
    I bless you, and you shall be blest."

    But meanwhile many a bark canoe,
    Bearing those Neuter warriors true
    Was rapidly coming down the tide,
    Along the path, where the waves divide.

    As the Isle these warriors reached,
    Their frail canoes they safely beached,
    Then stepped to the Chieftain's side;
    Beneath that grand primeval wood
    In awe-felt silence, there they stood.
    It was a noble sight, and good,
    For the Priest, in his holy pride.

    For of the bravest of the land
    Was that converted warrior band,
    All firm in their new Belief;
    And, on this wondrous Island's sod,
    Before that holy man of God,
    Knelt their baptizéd Chief.

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
